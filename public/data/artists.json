        "Aqyila spent months fine-tuning her debut LP with collaborators Maya J'an B, Jonathan Elkær, and Kasey Phillips. The result is a lush 11-track project that moves between late-night R&B vulnerability and Caribbean-tinged confidence. Two days after the album dropped, she took home Contemporary R&B/Soul Recording of the Year at the 2025 JUNOs for her single \"Bloom.\"",
        "Raised in a Jamaican household in Toronto's Downsview neighbourhood, Aqyila's sound is rooted in the gospel, jazz, and soul records her family played on repeat. Her 2021 breakout \"Vibe for Me\" earned millions of streams and a cosign from Lizzo. Three years later she's a two-time JUNO winner, a Spotify RADAR pick, and one of the strongest new voices carrying R&B forward."
